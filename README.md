## 📝 Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to address the following business-critical inventory questions:

### Key Performance Indicators
- How many items require immediate reorder?
- How many items are at shelf-life risk?
- What is the total stock value currently held?
- How many items are slow-moving?
- What is the total reorder value needed?
- How many units are expired?
- What is the inventory turnover rate?
- What is the stock coverage period in days?
- How many high-value items are in inventory?
- What is the reorder frequency across categories?

### Inventory & Category Analysis
- Which categories contribute the highest stock value and reorder value?
- What is the distribution of stock across categories?
- What are the top 10 items that need urgent reorder?
- Which items have the lowest inventory rate?
- Which suppliers contribute the highest reorder value?
- How does the reorder alert count vary by category?
- What is the investment distribution across product categories?

These requirements guide the dashboard design and the insights derived.
